Nos PartenairesTraces & Cie développe la culture vivante en milieu rural. Festival Haute Fréquence 2.0 2024 Le festival Haute Fréquence 2.0 débarque à l'Horloge d'Ollencourt ! La culture reste au cœur des préoccupations de la Région Hauts-de-France et le festival Haute-Fréquence est l’un de ses porte-drapeaux dans le domaine des musiques actuelles, pour offrir une culture pour tous et partout dans la région. Billy ze Kick (Reggae / Techno / Pop) � Rennes Ils se sont amusés à choquer la France avec leurs titres (Mangez-moi, OCB...), mais ils constituent surtout l�un des groupes au succès fulgurant ayant marqué toutes les mémoires. Aujourd'hui en équipe réduite, c'est pour un anniversaire que Billy ze Kick débarque à l'Horloge lors de ce concert où morceaux des origines et ceux d�aujourd�hui fusionneront pour une soirée festive et agitée durant la quelle Billy vous réserve que des surprises... � Billy Ze Kick sur Facebook � Billy Ze Kick sur Youtube Les Doigts qui Collent (Swing / Hop´n´Roll) � Creil LDQC, alias Les Doigts Qui Collent, c�est 10 années d�existence, 180 concerts au compteur, autant de litres de sueur, de l�humour, de l�amour et une réelle envie de partage avec le public. Partager leur swing hop & roll décomplexé avec le sourire et en toutes circonstances, voilà l�aspiration de ces huit musiciens isariens, originaires du bassin creillois. Musicalement, la recette est simple. Prenez un grand fait-tout, mélangez-y des compositions et des standards, agrémentez cette mixture sonore d�un zeste de hip-hop, d�une pincée de swing, d�une cuillerée de musique folklorique, arrosez le tout de bonne humeur et servez cela accompagné du traditionnel « salade, tomates, houblon », supplément chômage. Allez circulez, y�a rien à boire ! � Les Doigts qui Collent sur Facebook � Les Doigts qui Collent sur le WebTraces & Cie développe la culture vivante en milieu rural. - www.indexexpos.htmTraces & Cie développe la culture vivante en milieu rural.
